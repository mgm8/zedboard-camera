CHECK-3#1 Warning

REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/axi_interface_0/U0/axi_interface_v2_37a_S00_AXI_inst/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/axi_interface_0/U0/axi_interface_v2_37a_S00_AXI_inst/read_enable_INST_0/O, cell design_1_i/axi_interface_0/U0/axi_interface_v2_37a_S00_AXI_inst/read_enable_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_1_i/axi_interface_0/U0/axi_interface_v2_37a_S00_AXI_inst/read_enable_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 122 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
